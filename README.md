Implementation of Domain Adversarial Network for hashing
(refer to the paper: unsupervised domain adaptation by backpropagation)

To run the main training process, run run.py (you will need to have [ml_toolkit](https://github.com/MarkusZhang/ml_toolkit) installed to run the program). It will run both training and testing, and save the models and results.

The folder "expr_suites" contains the scripts for running DANN with some other settings, refer to the README under the folder
